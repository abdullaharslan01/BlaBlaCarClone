# BlaBlaCar App Clone

Since BlaBlaCar is an app I use daily and enjoy, I wanted to create a clone by examining its screens and designing it with estimated sizes. This project was created to develop a clone of the BlaBlaCar app in terms of functionality and appearance. I opened the real BlaBlaCar app on my phone and examined each screen, then designed the clone based on that. The app was developed to reflect the user experience as accurately as possible.

Below, you can find a video showcasing how the app clone works and its design. Feel free to watch the video for a more detailed look.
